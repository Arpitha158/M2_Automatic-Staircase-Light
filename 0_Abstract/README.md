AUTOMATIC STAIRCASE LIGHT


We all know that one of the places where power wastage occurs most in homes and offices is at staircases. We usually turn on light at stairs and leave it in a hurry.
In this project we are going to design a stair case lamp which works on battery and only turn on the lights only when someone is present at there. 
This circuit can be used to save power and it can be used as an emergency backup light.
The circuit works on two conditions - one is presence of light in its location and second is presence of human being, only when these two conditions are met, the controller turns the backup light ON.
These two conditions are tested by two sensors one is LDR and other is PIR Motion sensor module.
The LDR senses the presence of light and Motion sensor detects the presence of a human being in its range.
